function Test-DeviceStatusAndEnrollment {

    <#
.SYNOPSIS
    Evaluates the device's join status (Workgroup, Azure AD, Hybrid, or On-prem) and its Microsoft Intune enrollment status.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function retrieves the device's join status using `Get-DSRegStatus` and determines whether the device is joined to Workgroup, Azure AD, Hybrid, or On-prem environments. It also checks if the device is enrolled in Microsoft Intune (MDM). 
    Based on the evaluation, the function logs relevant details, displays the status in a form, and uses color-coded console outputs to reflect the device status. The function can also set appropriate exit codes based on the status to indicate whether a device migration is necessary.

.PARAMETER None
    This function takes no parameters.

.OUTPUTS
    Logs the device join and MDM enrollment status to enhanced logs and displays the status in both the console (color-coded) and a form window for the user.

.EXAMPLES
    Example 1:
    Test-DeviceStatusAndEnrollment

    This example checks the current deviceâ€™s join status and Intune (MDM) enrollment status, logs the results, and displays them in a form and the console.

.NOTES
    - This function relies on the `Get-DSRegStatus` function to retrieve the device's registration and join status.
    - Color-coding is used in the console output to easily distinguish between different statuses.
    - The exit code 0 indicates the device is Azure AD joined and Intune enrolled, requiring no migration.
    - Other statuses may require further action, and the exit code is set accordingly.
